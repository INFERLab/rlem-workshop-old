<p><b> Data-driven Control of Complex Engineering Systems
</b></p>

<p><b>Abstract: </b>
Optimal control of complex engineering systems is an extremely hard task. The classical approach, based on optimal control concepts (such as model-predictive control), is infeasible for large-scale systems where the accurate model is unavailable or is expensive to develop. Thus, machine learning (ML) approaches are becoming a popular alternative. In this talk, we will overview two most popular ML-based approaches, one based on reinforcement learning and another based on data-driven predictive control, their variants, and their application to optimal control of grid-interactive buildings.

<p><b>Bio: </b>
Andrey Bernstein received his B.Sc., M.Sc., and PhD degrees in Electrical
Engineering from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. Between 2010 and 2011,
he was a visiting researcher at Columbia University. During 2011-2012, he
was a visiting Assistant Professor at the Stony Brook University. From
2013 to 2016, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Laboratory for
Communications and Applications of Ecole Polytechnique Federale de
Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. Since October 2016 he has been a Senior
Researcher and Group Manager at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA.
His research interests are in the decision and control problems in complex
environments and related optimization and machine learning methods, with
application to power and energy systems.
