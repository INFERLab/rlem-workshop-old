<div class="venue">

<p>Buildings account for 40% of the global energy consumption and 30% of 
	the associated greenhouse gas emissions, while also offering a 50â€“90% CO2 
	mitigation potential. The transportation sector is responsible for an 
	additional 30%. Optimal decarbonization requires electrification of end-uses 
	and concomitant decarbonization of electricity supply, efficient use of electricity 
	for lighting, space heating, cooling and ventilation (HVAC), and domestic hot 
	water generation, and upgrade of the thermal properties of buildings. 
	A major driver for decarbonization are integration of renewable energy systems (RES) 
	into the grid, and photovoltaics (PV) and solar-thermal collectors as well as thermal 
	and electric storage into residential and commercial buildings. Electric vehicles (EVs), 
	with their storage capacity and inherent connectivity, hold a great potential for 
	integration with buildings. </p>
	
<p>The integration of these technologies must be done carefully to unlock their full potential. 
	Artificial intelligence is regarded as a possible pathway to orchestrate these 
	complexities of Smart Cities. In particular, (deep) reinforcement learning algorithms 
	have seen an increased interest and have demonstrated human expert level performance 
	in other domains, e.g., computer games. Research in the building and cities domain 
	has been fragmented and with focus on different problems and using a variety of frameworks. 
	The purpose of this Workshop is to build a growing community around this exciting topic, 
	provide a platform for discussion for future research direction, and share common frameworks.</p>

	
<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenges and Opportunities for RL in Building and Cities</li>
<li>Explorations of model vs model-free RL algorithms and hybrids</li>
<li>Comparisons of RL algorithms to other control solutions, e.g., model-predictive control</li>
<li>Frameworks and datasets for benchmarking algorithms</li>
<li>Theoretical contributions to the RL field brought about by constraints/challenges in the buildings/cities domain</li>
<li>Applications (demand response, HVAC control, occupant integration, traffic scheduling, EV/battery charging, DER integration)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
<p>Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Paper submissions must be at most 4 single-spaced US Letter (8.5"x11") pages, including figures, tables, and appendices (excluding references). All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions by (1) using the "anonymous" option for the class and (2) using "anonsuppress" section where appropriate. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. Please note that ACM uses 9-pt fonts in all conference proceedings, and the style (both LaTeX and Word) implicitly define the font size to be 9-pt.</p>
